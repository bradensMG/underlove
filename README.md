<p>Not much is done for it, but I decided to make the repository public anyway.</p>

# UNDERLÖVE Engine
<p>UNDERLÖVE is a UNDERTALE engine made with the LÖVE2D game framework. This is a remake of my previous engine, being remade entirely from scratch to put development convenience over accuracy. This is still a work in progress, but I decided to make this repository public in case anyone wanted to see the engine remake's development.</p>

<p>This engine is developed for fun, you're more than welcome to use or modify it! It's still unfinished right now, but hopefully, it'll be in a state where it can be useful to people!</p>
