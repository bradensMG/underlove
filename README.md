# UNDERLÖVE Engine
<p>UNDERLÖVE is an UNDERTALE engine made with the LÖVE2D game framework. This is a remake of my previous engine, being remade entirely from scratch to put development convinience over accuracy. This is very much a work in progress still but I decided to make this repository public in case anyone wanted to see the engine remake's development.</p>

<p>This engine is developed for fun, you're more than welcome to use or make modifications to it! I don't recommend using it in its current state as it's still very unfinished, but hopefully soon it'll be in a state that it can be useful to everyone!</p>
